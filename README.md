# ArtMap

### Idea
ArtMap is a web app that gives users the ability to add their favorite artspots to a map, keep track of the history of their favorite spots over time, and discover new artspots that other users have added. Users can also add comments on their favorite artspots, sparking discussions and keeping track of changes at the sites. Add murals, street art, graffiti, art museums, galleries, yard art, public statues, sculpture gardens, and more.

### Tech
ArtMap is a Meteor.js app. The Leaflet.js library brings the art to life on the map, and OpenStreetMap provides beautiful tiles for the map. On the front-end, ArtMap uses Twitter Bootstrap. ArtMap uses Blaze layout, Font Awesome, Iron router, and Moment for time parsing.
